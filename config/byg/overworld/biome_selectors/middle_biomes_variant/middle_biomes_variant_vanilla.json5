Appearing on terrain ABOVE weirdness 0, here is the "middle_biomes_variant" layout:

[ ARID-ICY, DRY-ICY, NEUTRAL-ICY, WET-ICY, HUMID-ICY ],
[ ARID-COLD, DRY-COLD, NEUTRAL-COLD, WET-COLD, HUMID-COLD ],
[ ARID-NEUTRAL, DRY-NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL-NEUTRAL, WET-NEUTRAL, HUMID-NEUTRAL ],
[ ARID-WARM, DRY-WARM, NEUTRAL-WARM, WET-WARM, HUMID-WARM ],
[ ARID-HOT, DRY-HOT, NEUTRAL-HOT, WET-HOT, HUMID-HOT ]

All keys passed in must be valid in the biome registry!
In slots containing "minecraft:the_void", biomes at the equivalent temperature/humidity index in "middle_biomes" will be used instead.
