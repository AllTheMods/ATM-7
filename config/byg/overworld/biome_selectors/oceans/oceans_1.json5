Appearing on terrain below sea level, here is the "ocean_biomes" layout:
[ SHALLOW-ICY, SHALLOW-COLD, SHALLOW-NEUTRAL, SHALLOW-WARM, SHALLOW-HOT ],
[ DEEP-ICY, DEEP-COLD, DEEP-NEUTRAL, DEEP-WARM, DEEP-HOT ]

All keys passed in must be valid in the biome registry!
"minecraft:the_void" is invalid as it represents a value of "NULL(nothing)" internally.
